# 848 HW1

This is a homework project originally forked from this [repository](https://github.com/Pinafore/848-hw) for a graduate class at the University of Maryland on Human-Computer Question Answering. This was a group project, where I was one of three collaborators working to improve a QuizBowl system through feature engineering.
